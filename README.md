# About Me
I'm an NC artist and I love martial arts and rap music. I've lived across the state and would eventually like to travel more.
## My interests
Like previously mentioned, I have a deep passion for martial arts. I enjoy watching MMA, boxing, and kickboxing events, and I've been a Muay Thai practitioner for 4 years. I've also been making music for a long time. I started writing music when I was 10 and I've been recording since I was 15.
