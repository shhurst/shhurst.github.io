# About Me
I'm an NC artist and I love martial arts and rap music. I've lived across the state and would eventually like to travel more.
## My interests
Like previously mentioned, I have a deep passion for martial arts. I enjoy watching MMA, boxing, and kickboxing events, and I've been a Muay Thai practitioner for 4 years. I've also been making music for a long time. I started writing music when I was 10 and I've been recording since I was 15.

# Mermaid Assignment
Using mermaid, I detail the steps to an effective Muay Thai roundhouse kick in a Flowchart.
```flowchart TD
    A[How to throw a Rear Roundhouse Kick]
    B(Step 1: Lead Foot step)-->|Take a small step forward with your left foot. Be mindful to stay on the balls of your feet.|C(Step 2: Rear Knee elevation)
    C-->|After a small step, begin to elevate your rear knee towards your target|D(Step 3: Rear Arm swing)
    D-->|Swing your rear arm downwards, almost simultaneously with your knee elevation |E(Step 4: Right Hip rotation)
    E-->|Rotate your hips to the right while nearing the climax of your arm swing and knee elevation |F(Step 5: Rear Leg extension)
    F-->|Extend the rear leg directly at the target, striking with the lower half of your shin| G(Step 6: Return to stance)
    G-->|Following the strike relax your rear leg, allowing the rear foot to return. Adjust lead foot to properly return to nuetral stance.|H{Complete!}
    I[Tips:]-->J[Echale upon strike impact, Inhale after.]
    J-->K[Keep core muscles engaged and stay on the balls of your feet throughout to stay balanced.]
    K-->L[Relax your body until the point of impact.]
    L-->M[Use the inner point of your patella to aim at your target directly while kicking. The kick will go as high as the knee is elevated, and proper hip rotation will allow the shin to land whereever it aims.]
    M-->N[In practice you should aim for the same points of contact for corresponding High, Middle or Low kick. For example: Practice aiming at the outer side of the lower lead leg quadricep **everytime**.]
